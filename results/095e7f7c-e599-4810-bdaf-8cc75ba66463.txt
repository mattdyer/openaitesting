Give me a paragraph about frogs like it was written by a scientist

Frogs are amphibians of the order Anura, which are characterized by a short body, webbed digits, protruding eyes, and the absence of a tail. They are found in a variety of habitats, ranging from tropical rainforests to deserts, and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Frogs have a wide range of diets, including insects, worms, spiders, and even small fish. They are an important part of the food chain, as they are both predators and prey. Frogs are also important indicators of environmental health, as their presence or absence can be used to measure the health of a given ecosystem.
