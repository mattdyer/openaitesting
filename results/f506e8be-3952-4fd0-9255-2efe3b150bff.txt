Give me a poem about turtles written by a scottish person

Oh, turtles so wise and so slow
Living in the sea, they do go
Their shells so hard and their eyes so bright
They are a sight to behold at night

Their flippers so strong, they can swim so far
From the shore to the depths of the sea, they do roam
Their shells so tough, they can take a hit
From the waves and the rocks, they never quit

Their shells so colorful, they can be seen
From the shore to the depths of the sea
Their shells so strong, they can take a hit
From the waves and the rocks, they never quit

Oh, turtles so wise and so slow
Living in the sea, they do go
Their shells so hard and their eyes so bright
They are a sight to behold at night.
