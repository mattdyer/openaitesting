Give me a poem about turtles written with a scottish accent

Oh, turtles, ye wee scaly creatures
Ye roam the sea with yer wee flippers
Ye're slow and steady, but ye can be fast
When ye need tae get away in a flash

Ye've been around since the days of old
Ye've seen the world and its many folds
Ye've been around since the days of yore
And ye'll be around for many more

Ye're a symbol of patience and strength
Ye can survive in any length
Ye can live in the sea or on land
Ye can even survive in the sand

Ye're a symbol of wisdom and grace
Ye can survive in any place
Ye can live in the sea or on land
Ye can even survive in the sand

Ye're a symbol of life and of love
Ye can survive in the sky above
Ye can live in the sea or on land
Ye can even survive in the sand

Ye're a symbol of hope and of peace
Ye can survive in any lease
Ye can live in the sea or on land
Ye can even survive in the sand.
