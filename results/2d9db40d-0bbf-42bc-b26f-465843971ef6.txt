Give me a page of dialogue for a new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

ARNOLD: I'm back!

VILLAIN: You think you can just come back here and take over?

ARNOLD: I don't think, I know.

VILLAIN: You're not the same man you used to be.

ARNOLD: I'm better.

VILLAIN: We'll see about that.

ARNOLD: I'm ready for whatever you throw at me.

VILLAIN: You won't be able to handle it.

ARNOLD: Try me.
