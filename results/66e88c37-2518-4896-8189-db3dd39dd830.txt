Give me a poem about turtles written in the style of a five year old

Turtles are so cool
They swim in the pool
They have shells on their back
And they never lack

They eat lettuce and bugs
And they never shrug
They like to hide in the sand
And they never land

They are so slow
But they always go
They like to eat and sleep
And they never weep
