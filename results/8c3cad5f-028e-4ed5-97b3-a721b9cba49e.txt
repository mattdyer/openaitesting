We are pleased to announce that Christmas is coming a day early this year! This year, Christmas will be celebrated on December 24th instead of the usual December 25th.

We understand that this may come as a surprise to some of you, but we are confident that this change will be beneficial for everyone. We are sure that you will all be able to make the most of the extra day and enjoy the holiday season with your loved ones.

We hope that you will take advantage of this extra day to spend time with your family and friends, and to enjoy the holiday season.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Management
